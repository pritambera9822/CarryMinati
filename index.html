    <p>Ajey Nagar is based in Faridabad, a city near India's national capital New Delhi.[4] Popularly referred to as CarryMinati,[5] Nagar is mainly involved in creating Hindi-language roasting and comedy videos, diss songs, satirical parodies, apart from live gaming.[1][6] Nagar and his team produce videos out of his home in Faridabad.[5]

        Nagar began posting videos on YouTube at the age of 10.[4] His main YouTube channel has been active since 2014.[7] In 2014, the channel's name was AddictedA1 and Nagar would upload recorded video game footage along with his reactions to the game.[8] In 2015, he changed the channel's name to CarryDeol, uploading gameplay footage of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive while mimicking Sunny Deol. The channel was subsequently renamed to CarryMinati.[9] In May 2021, Nagar released a statement saying that the channel had more than 30 million subscribers.[10]
        
        In early 2017, Nagar created an additional YouTube channel called CarryIsLive, where he live-streams himself playing video games.[7] He has hosted live-streams on this channel, raising funds for victims of cyclone Fani in Odisha in 2019,[11] and the flooding in Assam and Bihar in 2020.[12]
        
        In 2019, Nagar was listed at the 10th position in the Next Generation Leaders' 2019 by Time magazine, which is an annual list of ten young people who construct innovative careers.[13] In April 2020 he was part of Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia[14]
